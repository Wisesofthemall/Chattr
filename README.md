## Technologies Explained

### React

Chattr is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and maintainable.

### Socket.io

Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. Chattr utilizes Socket.io to establish a persistent connection between the client and server, ensuring instant message delivery and updates.

### MongoDB

Chattr employs MongoDB as its database system to store and manage user data, chat messages, and other relevant information. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides scalability and flexibility for handling large amounts of data.

### Express

Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web servers. Chattr uses Express to handle HTTP requests, routing, and middleware implementation.

### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side. Chattr utilizes Node.js as the backend technology to handle server-side logic, database operations, and WebSocket communication.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

JWT is a compact and secure method for transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Chattr uses JWT for user authentication, generating and verifying tokens to ensure secure communication and authorization.

### Heroku

Chattr is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform that allows easy hosting, scaling, and management of web applications. Heroku provides a simple deployment process, allowing Chattr to be accessible to users worldwide.
